We adopt dynamically regularized Lagrange multiplier[^1] (DRLM) schemes as the solver for the Navier-Stokes equation. The reference solution is obtained by solving the equations using second-order DRLM scheme, while the filtering process is performed by using a first-order DRLM. 
The description for the Taylor-Green vortex problem can be found in [^1]. The external force driven problem is designed to mimic the flow in an infinite channel without any obstacle.
