This folder coontains the codes for executing the EnSF and LETKF algorithms for estimating the solution to the 2D Burgers' equation under a specific amount of observational data.
The observational data is synthetic and is generated by solving the 2D Burgers' equation numerically.
It is well-known that for the Burgers' equations (or for the hyperbolic PDEs in general), even if the initial conditions are smooth, 
the solutions will eventually develop discontinuities or sharp corner at a certain time T. To handle those discontinuities, we employ SSP-RK schemes[^1][^2]
to solve the target equations.  

The implementation of the SSP-RK2 in pytorch are coded in **Burger2D_SSPRK2.py**.  
To run the EnSF algorithm with no in-painting (IP) technique, execute the file **EnSF_2DBurger_SSPRK2_NoIP.ipynb**.  
To run the LETKF algorithm, run the file **LETKF_2DBurger_SSPRK2.ipynb**.  
The EnSF with bi-harmonic and with Navier-Stokes IP are shown in **EnSF_2DBurger_SSPRK2_WithBiHInpainting.ipynb** and **EnSF_2DBurger_SSPRK2_WithNSInpainting.ipynb**, respectively.
