This folder contains the code for running the EnSF and LETKF algorithms to estimate solutions of the 2D Burgers’ equation from synthetic observations. The data are generated by numerically solving the 2D Burgers’ equation. It is well known that even smooth initial conditions can develop discontinuities (shocks) in finite time for Burgers’ equation (and hyperbolic PDEs in general). To handle these shocks, we employ strong-stability-preserving Runge–Kutta (SSP-RK) schemes [^1][^2].  

> [!NOTE]
>The implementation of the SSP-RK2 in pytorch are coded in **Burger2D_SSPRK2.py**.  
To run the EnSF algorithm with no in-painting (IP) technique, execute the file **EnSF_2DBurger_SSPRK2_NoIP.ipynb**.  
To run the LETKF algorithm, run the file **LETKF_2DBurger_SSPRK2.ipynb**.  
The EnSF with bi-harmonic and with Navier-Stokes IP are shown in **EnSF_2DBurger_SSPRK2_WithBiHInpainting.ipynb** and **EnSF_2DBurger_SSPRK2_WithNSInpainting.ipynb**, respectively.
