This folder coontains the codes for executing the EnSF and LETKF algorithms for estimating the solution to the 2D Burgers' equation under a specific amount of observational data. The observational data is synthetic and is generated by solving the 2D Burgers' equation numerically.
$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$
