# State Estimation for Burgers' Equations
The equations are first discretized using numerical solver. Note that theoretically, one can choose any method that they want, \
however, it is best to choose the schemes that are easy to implement and to incorporate the data assimilation algorithm. Therefore, \
we choose the simplest form of the SSP-RK scheme for the numerical solver, even though there are more advance variant of this method.
