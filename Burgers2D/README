This folder coontains the codes for executing the EnSF and LETKF algorithms for estimating the solution to the 2D Burgers' equation under a specific amount of observational data.
The observational data is synthetic and is generated by solving the 2D Burgers' equation numerically.
It is well-known that for the Burgers' equations (or for the hyperbolic PDEs in general), even if the initial conditions are smooth, 
the solutions will eventually develop discontinuities or sharp corner at a certain time T. To handle those discontinuities, we employ SSP-RK schemes[^1][^2] 
to solve the target equations.
