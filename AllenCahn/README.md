We adopt a linear second-order maximum bound principle-preserving backward differentiation formula (BDF) scheme[^1] as the numerical solver for the Allen-Cahn equation with general mobility. We consider three types of mobility: constant, non-constant (i.e., spatially varying), and state-dependent. The reference solution is generated on a very fine time grid to yield reliable synthetic observational data, while the filtering process is performed on a coarsed one to reduce computational time. 

The numerical experiment is taken from [^1]. Because the solution at terminal time $T$ depends on the randomly chosen initial condition, users may obtain reference solutions that differ from ours and from those in [^1] :dizzy: :dizzy: .
