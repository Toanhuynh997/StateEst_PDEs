We adopt a linear second-order maximum bound principle-preserving backward differentiation formula (BDF) scheme[^1] as the numerical solver for the Allen-Cahn equation with general mobility. We consider three scenarios for the mobility: (1) Constant mobility. (2) Non-constant mobility. (3) State-dependent mobility. The reference solution is generated on a very fine time grid to yield reliable synthetic observational data, while the filtering process is performed on a coarsed one to reduce computational time.
